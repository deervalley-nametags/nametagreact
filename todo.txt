last thing was doing:

-remember to increment app version in the admin page(bottom)

todo(test before taking off):
-text val whole word exceptions for "and, of, or, the"
-make bronze tag look more metallic with stripes
-line cant start with a "," (wait, but the system does it when trying to spell out a state)
-render x2 x3 quantity in bot right corner
-black diamond line on render
-black bg indoor tag 
-better info text under title
-900 day db entry deletion every admin login
-spec character clickable button inputs
-black bg indoor tags
-club 1981 silver bg tags


admin page:
-pin cooks, service mags help tips page, alt codes
-mark as duplicate not printed red bg
-delete admin print buttons for outdoor
-separate page for undone tag search, or better search system when doing tags, organise by requestor or dept?
-undo the double .csv output for old tags(make them like the ski patrol and regular outdoors)
-make ALL outdoor tags output to 2 and 3 line multiline csv inputs without columns(so, combine the 2 and 3 liners)


multi tags:
-regular outdoor defaults to 2 magnets instead of 3 velcro
-uploadable .csv file possibility?


super future/not necessary but cool: 
-drawing editor for custom signage
-admin tool velvet outdoor tags, num rows = Math.floor((measured length - 6.6) / 3.25)
-admin page .csv export to UV printer?
-make an exact name 30 day checker confirmation window
